#### Topics / Technologies Used
* Java
* Foreach loops and If statements
* Switch Statement
* Multiple fields, constructors, and non-static methods.
* Multiple Classes
* Interfaces

#### Lessons Learned
  I utilized a lot of Foreach loops in this project. Before this project,
  I didn't fully comprehend what you could really do with these loops,
  especially with the Lists in this project. Utilizing the temporary variable
  allowed me to do a lot of the calculations, list manipulation, etc within
  relatively small independent methods. I was then able to utilize these
  methods all over my code in a very code friendly way, and easy to understand.
